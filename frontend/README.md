# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

main:

- import images
- pagination (load more)

to add (extra):

- add a icon instead of the vite icon
- landing page with pokeball animation
- add animation to literally everything
- caching https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/caching-in-react/
- look into apollo caching and polling
- pikachu loading animation on loading state for usequery hook
- add bookmarking feature to save pokemon and then when looking at pokemon saved show in cards format?
