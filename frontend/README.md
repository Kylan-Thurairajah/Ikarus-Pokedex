# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

to add:

- remove comments
- add a icon instead of the vite icon
- landing page with pokeball animation
- load more pagination
- when searching have cards show up instead of the table maybe
- add animation to literally everything
- add tooltips to the header row to explain what each thing represents (dk if this will work alongside hover highlight effect on header row)
- caching https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/caching-in-react/
